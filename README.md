# Sunbeam s390x single-LPAR core-charm verifier (2026.1 Gazpacho)

A set of idempotent shell scripts that deploy the **core Sunbeam charms** on a
single Z LPAR **as plain Juju bundles** (no `sunbeam` CLI), capture every
architecture-availability signal along the way, and run an upstream Tempest pass.

This is **diagnostic-first**: the scripts bring up Canonical K8s, deploy two Juju
bundles (a K8s control plane + a machine plane), and record what worked and what
didn't (including which snaps/OCI images have no s390x build), producing a tarball
of artifacts whether or not the deployment fully succeeds.

> **Why bundles instead of `sunbeam`?** The Sunbeam CLI couples the whole exercise
> to snap-openstack working end-to-end on s390x — exactly the thing that isn't ready
> — so it obscures whether the *charms themselves* work. Deploying the charms
> directly with `juju deploy <bundle>` lets us verify the core charms and feed
> precise per-image/per-snap arch gaps back upstream.

> **Realistic outcome:** Canonical K8s on s390x is not officially validated, and the
> OpenStack charm OCI images at `ghcr.io/canonical/...` plus the machine-side snaps
> (`openstack-hypervisor`, `microceph`, `cinder-volume`) are published from pipelines
> that do not all build z/power artifacts yet. So the headline deliverable of a run
> is most often a precise arch-availability report (`arch_report.md`) listing exactly
> what needs to be built before Sunbeam-on-s390x is viable. Tempest is best-effort
> downstream of that. See [K8s s390x prerequisites](#k8s-s390x-prerequisites) below.

## What gets deployed

Two Juju models on one controller (mirrors how Sunbeam splits things internally):

- **`openstack`** — a CAAS model on the Canonical K8s cloud, from
  [manifests/control-plane-k8s-s390x.yaml](manifests/control-plane-k8s-s390x.yaml):
  `mysql`, `rabbitmq`, `self-signed-certificates`, `traefik`, `ovn-central`,
  `ovn-relay`, `keystone`, `glance`, `placement`, `nova`, `neutron`, `cinder`
  (+`cinder-router`). Exports cross-model **offers** (amqp, identity-*, send-ca-cert,
  ovsdb-cms, certificates, nova-service, cinder-database).
- **`machines`** — an IAAS model on a **manual** cloud whose machine `0` is this LPAR,
  from [manifests/machine-lpar-s390x.yaml](manifests/machine-lpar-s390x.yaml):
  `sunbeam-machine`, `openstack-hypervisor`, `microceph`, `cinder-volume`,
  `cinder-volume-ceph`. Consumes the control-plane offers and exports
  `storage-backend` back to `cinder`.

The set mirrors the previous charmed-OpenStack LPAR validation bundle
([zopenstack noble-flamingo-edge](https://github.com/ubuntu-openstack/zopenstack/blob/main/bundles/lpar/noble-flamingo-edge.yaml))
— keystone/glance/nova/neutron/placement/cinder + a real compute hypervisor + ceph
block storage — but with the Sunbeam charms. **No feature charms** (horizon, heat,
octavia, magnum, manila, barbican, designate, ironic, telemetry, object storage). And
**no `tempest-k8s`** in the bundle: that charm has no s390x OCI image, so Tempest runs
via upstream `tox` (phase 06) instead.

## Runs on amd64 too

The whole workflow is arch-aware and also runs on **amd64**, so you can validate
the orchestration while s390x artifacts are still publishing. The deploy
architecture is auto-detected (`dpkg --print-architecture`) and overridable with
`TARGET_ARCH`. The only real difference is phase 02b:

- **s390x** — bootstraps K8s with cilium disabled, installs the vendored pe-ibm
  Calico, and rewrites addon images to upstream registries (cilium + several
  `ghcr.io/canonical` addon images have no z/power build).
- **amd64** — bootstraps stock Canonical K8s (cilium enabled), no Calico, no image
  rewrites.

Everything else (juju bootstrap, the two bundles, configure, guest/volume smoke,
tempest) is identical;
the bundles carry no `arch:` constraints so Juju picks the right charm revisions,
and phase 04 selects the matching Ubuntu cloud image (`...-cloudimg-<arch>.img`) and
glance `architecture` property automatically. On amd64 the `arch_report.md` rows
will all read `yes (amd64)`; the s390x gap discovery happens when you run on the
actual LPAR.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble), on s390x or amd64, for the complete two-model
  workflow. The K8s/control-plane tooling also runs on 26.04, but the published
  2026.1 machine-plane charms currently select Ubuntu 24.04 bases and cannot be
  placed directly on a Resolute manual machine.
- A user with passwordless `sudo` **and** key-based SSH back to the host (phase 02
  sets this up — it's needed to enrol the LPAR as a Juju manual machine).
- Outbound internet (Snap Store, ghcr.io, docker.io, charmhub) — see "Behind a proxy".
- ~32 GB RAM, ~200 GB disk.
- `/dev/kvm` (s390x KVM) for Nova to actually launch instances. Phase 02 records
  whether it's present.

## Behind a proxy

Set `PROXY_URL` before running anything; the phase scripts configure shell env,
`/etc/environment`, apt, snap, and the K8s snap's containerd via
[tools/setup_proxy.sh](tools/setup_proxy.sh):

```bash
export PROXY_URL=http://squid.internal:3128
export NO_PROXY_DEFAULT='localhost,127.0.0.1,::1,<host-ip>,<host-subnet>,10.1.0.0/16,10.152.183.0/24,.svc,.cluster.local,.charmhub.io,charmhub.io,.jujucharms.com,registry.jujucharms.com,streams.canonical.com'
./run.sh all
```

Define `NO_PROXY_DEFAULT` before deriving `NO_PROXY`. A combined assignment
such as `export NO_PROXY_DEFAULT=... NO_PROXY="$NO_PROXY_DEFAULT"` expands the
old value and can leave `NO_PROXY` empty. The symptom is `juju add-k8s`
failing with `Get "https://<node>:6443/...": Forbidden` because the Kubernetes
API request went through Squid. Phase 03 now applies `NO_PROXY_DEFAULT`
defensively.

The ps6 Squid currently rejects CONNECT requests to `api.charmhub.io`, while
the LPAR can reach it directly. Keep `.charmhub.io,charmhub.io` in
`NO_PROXY_DEFAULT`; phase 03 propagates that bypass into both Juju models.
The same applies to `registry.jujucharms.com`, which containerd uses for charm
OCI resources. Include `.jujucharms.com,registry.jujucharms.com`, then rerun
`tools/setup_proxy.sh` so the updated bypass reaches the containerd service.
Manual-machine enrolment also downloads the Juju agent index from
`streams.canonical.com`, which must bypass this Squid deployment.

Both `snap.k8s.k8sd.service` and `snap.k8s.containerd.service` need the proxy:
`k8sd` reconciles addons, while containerd pulls OCI images. Verify with:

```bash
sudo systemctl show snap.k8s.k8sd.service -p Environment --no-pager
sudo systemctl show snap.k8s.containerd.service -p Environment --no-pager
curl -I --connect-timeout 15 https://ghcr.io/v2/
```

The helper can also be run directly after exporting `PROXY_URL` and
`NO_PROXY_DEFAULT`; it derives its repository/run context automatically.

On ps6 the Squid allowlist must cover the OCI registries (`ghcr.io`, `docker.io`,
`registry.k8s.io`, `quay.io`) and registry redirects such as
`*.docker.pkg.dev`. The `ps6_s390x_openstack` ACL in
[canonical-is-internal-proxy-configs](https://launchpad.net/canonical-is-internal-proxy-configs)
already covers special18-22 (10.103.192.218-.222); other LPARs need a follow-up MP.

## Quickstart

```bash
cd s390x-sunbeam
./run.sh all
```

This creates `artifacts/<UTC-timestamp>/`, runs every phase in order, and on
completion gives two deliverables:

- `sunbeam-<arch>-<run-id>.tar.zst` — complete diagnostic archive.
- `test-share-<arch>-<run-id>.tar.zst` — compact, publishable validation report
  modelled on the
  [openstack-charmers/test-share s390x results](https://github.com/openstack-charmers/test-share/tree/master/s390x/2025-dec/noble-flamingo-ovn/multi-lpar).

For a gated amd64 verification, reserve a free L2 address range and run:

```bash
LB_CIDR=10.0.0.240-10.0.0.250 ./tools/verify_amd64.sh
```

For a single-NIC nested VM, a routed provider bridge can use the repository's
default external subnet:

```bash
LB_CIDR=10.0.0.240-10.0.0.250 \
EXTERNAL_BRIDGE_ADDRESS=172.16.2.1/24 \
./tools/verify_amd64.sh
```

The amd64 verifier requires `CHARM_SOURCE=charmhub`, stops at each failed gate,
boots a guest, attaches a volume, runs Tempest, and checks phase idempotency.

### Running a single phase

```bash
./run.sh 00          # host-fitness check
./run.sh 02b         # K8s + Calico bring-up
./run.sh 03          # control-plane bundle deploy
./run.sh 03b         # machine-plane bundle deploy
./run.sh --run-id 20260617T120000Z 04   # re-run configure in an existing run dir
```

Phases are idempotent: each writes `.status/<phase>.done` and short-circuits on
re-run unless you delete the sentinel.

## Phases

| #   | Script                          | Does                                                                                  |

| 03b | `03b_deploy_machine_plane.sh`   | Manual cloud + `machines` model + enrol LPAR as machine 0 + deploy machine bundle + wire `storage-backend` |
| 04  | `04_configure.sh`               | openrc via `keystone get-admin-account`; external network, flavors, s390x image (openstack CLI) |
| 04b | `04b_smoke_cloud.sh`             | Boot a guest, attach a Cinder volume, assign a floating IP, and prove SSH access       |
| 05  | `05_capture_state.sh`           | Per-model `juju export bundle`/`status`/`offers`, k8s dump, OCI/snap s390x sweep       |
| 06  | `06_validate_tempest.sh`        | Upstream tempest: `discover-tempest-config` → `tempest.conf`, `tox -e smoke`, failures |
| 99  | `99_collect_artifacts.sh`       | Build full diagnostics plus a compact test-share-compatible report                    |

In `./run.sh all` mode, a blocking failure skips dependent phases and proceeds
directly to 05 + 99 so you always get a post-mortem tarball.

## Charm source: Charmhub, hybrid, or local

Phases 03/03b deploy the same topology from one of three sources, selected by
`CHARM_SOURCE`:

- **`charmhub`** (default) — published charms on their `2026.1/edge` (etc.)
  channels, OCI images omitted so Juju pulls each revision's image. This is the
  diagnostic mode that surfaces per-image s390x gaps. Bundles:
  `manifests/control-plane-k8s-s390x.yaml`, `manifests/machine-lpar-s390x.yaml`.
- **`hybrid`** — the Noble/s390x qualification path while publication catches
  up. It generates bundles into the run artifact directory, using Charmhub for
  published components and these local artifacts:
  `rabbitmq-k8s_s390x.charm`, `microceph_s390x.charm`, and
  `cinder-volume-ceph_s390x.charm`. It also selects the currently available
  s390x TLS/Traefik channels and pins the RabbitMQ multi-architecture rock.
  Generated bundles use absolute paths for local charms because Juju resolves
  them relative to the bundle file under `artifacts/<run-id>/`.
- **`local`** — the Sunbeam charms we build for s390x, deployed from
  `./charms/*_s390x.charm` with their workload OCI images pinned to s390x rocks.
  This actually exercises our builds on the modified K8s substrate. Bundles:
  `manifests/control-plane-k8s-s390x-local.yaml`,
  `manifests/machine-lpar-s390x-local.yaml`. External dependencies we do **not**
  build (`mysql-k8s`, `rabbitmq-k8s`, `self-signed-certificates`, `traefik-k8s`,
  `mysql-router-k8s`, `microceph`) stay on charmhub in both modes.

```bash
# diagnostic, published charms (default)
./run.sh 03 && ./run.sh 03b
# published stack plus the three unpublished Noble/s390x charms
CHARM_SOURCE=hybrid ./run.sh 03 && CHARM_SOURCE=hybrid ./run.sh 03b
# our s390x builds
CHARM_SOURCE=local ./run.sh 03 && CHARM_SOURCE=local ./run.sh 03b
```

Hybrid mode fails preflight unless all three local charm files exist and declare
Ubuntu 24.04/s390x. Their expected location is `./charms/`.

For `local`: first stage the `.charm` files in `charms/` (see
[charms/README.md](charms/README.md)) and replace the `REPLACE-ME/...:s390x`
resource placeholders in `control-plane-k8s-s390x-local.yaml` with real s390x rock
refs. Heads-up: the external charmhub charms above still need their own s390x
images — check with `tools/check_oci_arch.sh` first, as a missing one there will
stall the deploy regardless of our charms.

## Useful environment overrides

| Variable | Default | Used by |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `TARGET_ARCH` | `dpkg --print-architecture` (amd64/s390x) | all (CNI path, arch checks, guest image) |
| `PROXY_URL` | unset | all (proxy setup) |
| `LB_CIDR` | derived `<host /24>.240-.250` | 02b load-balancer pool; set this explicitly to a reserved, unused L2 range |
| `K8S_CHANNEL` | `latest/edge` | 01/02b |
| `JUJU_CHANNEL` | `3/stable` | 01 |
| `JUJU_CONTROLLER` / `K8S_MODEL` / `MACHINE_MODEL` / `MANUAL_CLOUD` | `sunbeam-controller` / `openstack` / `machines` / `lpar-manual` | 03/03b/04/05/06 |
| `CHARM_SOURCE` | `charmhub` | 03/03b — `charmhub`, `hybrid`, or `local` (see "Charm source") |
| `BUNDLE` | per-phase `*-s390x.yaml` | 03/03b — explicit bundle path; overrides `CHARM_SOURCE` |
| `DEPLOY_TIMEOUT` | `3600` | 03/03b settle wait |
| `READINESS_TIMEOUT` | value of `DEPLOY_TIMEOUT` | 03b — final per-model wait for every unit workload to become active |
| `EXT_NET_NAME` / `EXT_SUBNET_RANGE` / `EXT_SUBNET_GW` / `EXT_SUBNET_POOL` / `EXT_PHYSNET` | external-network / 172.16.2.0/24 / .1 / .50-.200 / physnet1 | 04 |
| `EXTERNAL_BRIDGE_ADDRESS` | unset | 03b — optional routed-provider address applied to the hypervisor's `br-ex` (for example `172.16.2.1/24` on a single-NIC nested VM) |
| `IMAGE_URL` | Noble cloud image for `TARGET_ARCH` | 04 |
| `SMOKE_VALIDATE_SSH` / `SMOKE_SSH_USER` | `1` / `ubuntu` | 04b — floating-IP SSH acceptance check |
| `TEST_SHARE_NOTES_FILE` | unset | 99 — optional Markdown file appended as “Notes and known issues” in the publishable report |

Phase 03 sets the Juju model constraint `arch=$TARGET_ARCH` before deploying
applications. Without it, an amd64 Juju client can create every CAAS pod with
`nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/arch: amd64`, leaving all units Pending on the
s390x LPAR.

The current `traefik-k8s` s390x revision on `latest/edge` uses
`ubuntu@26.04`/Python 3.14 and contains a `google._upb._message` extension that
segfaults while importing OpenTelemetry protobuf modules. Phase 03 disables
that optional accelerator inside Traefik's charm venv so protobuf falls back
to its pure-Python implementation. Set `TRAEFIK_DISABLE_BROKEN_UPB=0` once a
fixed revision is published.

Phase 03 fails on unresolved `ErrImagePull`/`ImagePullBackOff` states, but it
does not require every workload to be active before phase 03b. Cinder is
expected to block until the machine-plane storage offer exists. Nova may also
briefly report a conductor crash loop because its Pebble liveness check runs
while the service is deliberately disabled pending relations; evaluate final
unit health after phase 03b wires both models together.

Phase 03b discovers the actual Juju ID of the enrolled manual machine and maps
bundle machine `0` to it. Juju does not reuse IDs after failed enrolment, so
hard-coding `0=0` can otherwise create an impossible extra machine on the
manual provider.

Phase 03b has two distinct gates. It first waits for Juju agents to finish
hooks, then requires every unit in both the `machines` and `openstack` models
to report an active workload. An idle agent with a blocked, waiting, or error
workload is therefore a failed phase rather than a false success.

The first s390x `openstack-hypervisor` revision tested on Noble
(`2026.1/edge`, snap revision 646 on June 25, 2026) had a strict-confinement
gap: `libvirtd` could not monitor `/etc/mdevctl.d`, exited, and the configure
hook subsequently failed because `virtqemud-sock` did not exist. The correct
snap-side fix is a read-only `system-files` plug for `/etc/mdevctl.d` connected
to the `libvirtd` app. Phase 03b detects this exact failure and stops with a
packaging error; do not disable AppArmor to hide it. The tested source patch is
kept at `patches/openstack-hypervisor-mdevctl-system-files.patch` until an
equivalent fix is published.

The same initial s390x build also staged the non-DPDK `ovs-vswitchd` binary at
`usr/lib/openvswitch-switch/ovs-vswitchd` without the package-maintainer-created
`usr/sbin/ovs-vswitchd` link. This causes `ovsdb-server` startup to fail while
setting the OVS version. The source patch also creates that fallback symlink
when the DPDK binary is unavailable.

The initial QEMU build list also omitted `s390x-softmmu`, leaving libvirt
without a native s390x emulator and causing Nova compute to fail its QEMU
minimum-version check. Apply
`patches/openstack-hypervisor-qemu-s390x-target.patch` when building the local
s390x snap.

The first guest boot can also fail with
`machine type 's390-ccw-virtio-*' does not support ACPI`. This is the Nova
s390x ACPI bug tracked as LP #2043987. For local validation builds, apply
`patches/openstack-hypervisor-nova-acpi-ppa.patch` so the hypervisor snap stages
Nova from `ppa:mylesjp/nova-acpi-patch`; then confirm the snapcraft build log or
`apt-cache policy python3-nova` inside the build environment selects that PPA.

The first s390x `cinder-volume` snap retained an app-level
`x86_64-linux-gnu/ceph` library path, so its bundled `rados` and `rbd` Python
modules could not load `libceph-common.so.2`. Apply
`patches/cinder-volume-ceph-library-triplet.patch` for an
architecture-correct Ceph library path.

Phase 04 uses Ubuntu's `python3-openstackclient` package. Installing the latest
client from PyPI on s390x can fall back to compiling `cryptography` with Rust
because upstream wheels are unavailable; this is slower, less reproducible,
and may fail on restricted-egress hosts.

## Artifact bundle contents

Each `artifacts/<run-id>/` contains:

- `env.txt`, `arch_report.md` (the headline s390x availability matrix)
- `phase_<N>_<name>.log` — per-phase timestamped output
- `juju_bundle_<model>.yaml`, `juju_status_<model>.txt`, `juju_status_relations_<model>.txt`, `juju_offers.txt`
- `juju_status_watch.log` — background status during deploy
- `k8s_resources.yaml`, `k8s_events.txt`, `k8s_nodes_describe.txt`, `snaps.txt`
- `manual-cloud.yaml`, `manual_host_ip`, `lb_cidr`, `get-admin-account.json`
- `cloud-admin-openrc`, `ca_bundle.pem` (if 04 ran)
- `tempest/` + `tempest_report/` (if 06 ran)
- `smoke_server.yaml`, `smoke_volume.yaml` (if 04b ran)
- `sunbeam-<arch>-<run-id>.tar.zst`
- `test-share/` and `test-share-<arch>-<run-id>.tar.zst`, containing a flat,
  human-reviewable report matching the legacy `openstack-charmers/test-share`
  s390x file names: `README.md`, `juju_status.txt`,
  `catalog_list.txt`, `hypervisor_list.txt`, `image_list.txt`,
  `network_list.txt`, `network_agent_list.txt`,
  `network_extension_list.txt`, `ceph_tests.txt`, `instance_launch.txt`,
  `instance_ssh.txt`, `openstack_origin.txt`, and `tempest_smoke.txt`.
  Sunbeam-specific bundle/K8s evidence remains in the full diagnostic archive.

## Load-balancer (most likely stall point)

`traefik-k8s` needs an external `LoadBalancer` IP, or keystone's `public_endpoint`
(hence the openrc `OS_AUTH_URL`) never resolves and phase 04/06 are unusable. Phase
02b enables the Canonical K8s load-balancer addon and sets an L2 pool (`LB_CIDR`). The
bundle's traefik `metallb.universe.tf/address-pool=public` annotation is a no-op for
that addon — we rely on the addon's own pool. If the addon's L2 announcer (Cilium
based) does not function under Calico on your LPAR, install MetalLB and create a pool
named `public` to match the annotation. Verify with `sudo k8s kubectl get svc -A`
before trusting phase 04.

## Reset between runs

```bash
juju destroy-controller sunbeam-controller --destroy-all-models --no-prompt || true
juju remove-cloud lpar-manual --client || true
juju remove-cloud sunbeam-k8s --client || true
sudo k8s kubectl delete pod s390x-smoke --ignore-not-found || true
sudo snap remove --purge k8s juju openstack-hypervisor microceph cinder-volume || true
sudo rm -rf /var/snap/k8s ~/.local/share/juju
```

Then start fresh: `./run.sh all`.

## K8s s390x prerequisites

The Canonical K8s snap does not work out-of-the-box on s390x — its default CNI
(cilium) has no z/power build, and several bundled addon images at
`ghcr.io/canonical/...` are also not published for s390x. The Performance Engineering /
IBM Z alliances team has a working recipe in
[canonical/pe-ibm-microk8s-validation](https://github.com/canonical/pe-ibm-microk8s-validation)
(branch `c-k8s-and-calico-experimental`). Phase 02b encodes it:

1. `sudo k8s bootstrap --file <cfg>` with `network.enabled: false` (no cilium).
2. `sudo k8s kubectl apply -f vendor/pe-ibm/calico.yaml` — the *patched* Calico manifest.
3. Remove Metrics Server on s390x; it is not required by OpenStack.
4. Enable dns, local-storage, and load-balancer. The s390x path removes the
   unused CSI resizer/snapshotter sidecars and rewrites required CSI/MetalLB
   sidecars to upstream multi-architecture images.
5. Use a locally built `rawfile-localpv:0.8.3` s390x image. Canonical's
   `ghcr.io/canonical/rawfile-localpv:0.8.3-ck2` currently publishes amd64 and
   arm64 only. The source recipe is
   [canonical/rawfile-localpv-rocks](https://github.com/canonical/rawfile-localpv-rocks).
6. A smoke pod confirms scheduling, image pull, and pod networking on the LPAR.
7. A PVC/consumer pod must bind and reach Ready, and MetalLB must have both its
   controller and speaker running, before phase 03.

Useful live diagnostics:

```bash
sudo k8s kubectl get nodes
sudo k8s kubectl get pods -A
sudo k8s kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | tail -40
sudo k8s status
```

Do not continue to Juju merely because the node is `Ready`: the PVC and
LoadBalancer gates must also pass.

### Build rawfile-localpv locally on the LPAR

Launchpad remote-build is not required. On the Noble s390x LPAR, install
Rockcraft and LXD, then run the repository helper:

```bash
sudo snap install rockcraft --classic
sudo snap install lxd
sudo lxd init --auto
./tools/build_rawfile_localpv_rock.sh
```

The patch carried in `patches/rawfile-localpv-s390x.patch` adds the s390x
platform, removes the Ubuntu Pro-only FIPS staging part, and makes `grpcio`
use Ubuntu's OpenSSL. Its bundled BoringSSL otherwise fails with `Unknown
target CPU` on s390x. The generated protobuf modules are committed upstream,
so the runtime image does not need `grpcio-tools`.

When Canonical K8s is already running, the helper also imports the resulting
`.rock` through `/run/containerd/containerd.sock` and tags it as
`docker.io/library/rawfile-localpv:0.8.3-s390x`. Phase 02b rewrites the
addon's rawfile driver to that local tag. Override it, if needed, with
`RAWFILE_LOCALPV_IMAGE`.

If the LPAR's proxy blocks the redirect from `registry.k8s.io` to
`*.pkg.dev`, sideload the registrar and provisioner from a workstation with
Docker and direct registry access:

```bash
./tools/sideload_s390x_k8s_images.sh ubuntu@10.103.192.218
```

The helper uses containerized Skopeo to select the s390x manifests, transfers
OCI archives over SSH, imports them through Canonical K8s's containerd socket,
and restarts the rawfile CSI pods. A successful result is controller `1/1`
and node `3/3`:

```bash
sudo k8s kubectl -n kube-system get pods \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/name=rawfile-csi
```

### Vendoring workflow

Before the first run, populate `vendor/pe-ibm/`:

```bash
./tools/refresh_pe_ibm.sh
```

## Tempest

Phase 06 follows the [zopenstack](https://github.com/ubuntu-openstack/zopenstack)
workflow shape (`grep FAILED`, artifact/report capture, per-test re-runs) with
Sunbeam-appropriate substitutions:

1. **`tempest.conf` is generated by upstream `python-tempestconf`** against the live
   cloud via the openrc phase 04 produced — no charmed-OpenStack template.
2. **No K8s-charm-specific bits.** Per-service diagnostics use the openrc +
   `openstack` CLI instead of parsing `juju status keystone`.
3. **Direct smoke execution is the default.** The phase runs
   `tempest run --smoke --serial` from its validation venv. Set
   `TEMPEST_USE_TOX=1` if you specifically want to exercise upstream Tempest's
   tox environment; on lab hosts behind internal proxies, tox may fail while
   fetching OpenStack upper-constraints.

`python-tempestconf` debug logging is disabled by default because it may echo
auth material into `tempestconf.log`. Set `TEMPESTCONF_DEBUG=1` only when you
need verbose config-generation traces and will handle the resulting artifacts as
sensitive.

With compute + block storage deployed, full smoke (boot an instance, create a volume)
is meaningful. We vendor only the **exclude-list** from zopenstack (under
[vendor/zopenstack/](vendor/zopenstack/)). The default excludes currently cover:

- charmed-keystone policy tests inherited from zopenstack; re-evaluate these
  against keystone-k8s as policy coverage improves.
- `tempest.scenario.test_network_basic_ops.TestNetworkBasicOps.test_network_basic_ops`,
  because it requires the validation host to ping floating IPs allocated from
  `EXT_SUBNET_POOL`. Many LPAR lab networks can create provider-network
  resources but do not route that floating-IP range back to the runner. Remove
  this exclusion when your external network is genuinely reachable from the
  Tempest host.

### Re-running a single test

```bash
./tools/run_tempest_test.sh 'test_dashboard_basic_ops.TestDashboardBasicOps.test_basic_scenario'
```

Defaults to the most recent run-id; pass `--run-id <id>` to target a specific one.

## Channel pins (subject to change)

Set in the two bundle files (and the `*_CHANNEL` defaults in
[scripts/01_install_prereqs.sh](scripts/01_install_prereqs.sh)) if Sunbeam publishes
2026.1 to a non-edge risk level.
